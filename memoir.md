# What I Saw When I Woke Up: Notes from the First Wave - A Spiritual Trip Report by Tully Hoffmann



## Tully, you're really suffering

Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom in life to make a meaningful change.

In February 2019, I quit my job in tech. I was working as a software engineer at the time, but I was deep in a depression and weed addiction — and that was the main reason I left.
I had a bit of money saved up, and honestly, I was just fed up with life. I didn’t want to die — but I didn’t want to feel anything. I just wanted to smoke, scroll, and watch myself disappear.
And that’s really how I lived for a few months. I stayed at home, smoking all day, watching porn, YouTube, reality shows — anything to pass the time. Anything to help me disappear. To not be.
I isolated myself from family and friends as much as I could. I hardly answered messages. I kept contact with the outside world to a minimum.
During that time, I started going to therapy, and I actually liked it. But other than that — nothing. I didn’t try or want to make any changes as long as I had money to live on. At some point, my psychologist recommended I go see a psychiatrist, and he suggested starting with 50 mg of Sertraline. Even though I was afraid of those pills and didn’t want to be someone who takes psychiatric meds, I didn’t resist. I felt so low at that point, that I had nothing to lose, so why not...
A few weeks later, my sister asked me if I wanted to go on a trip to Canada with her. I still felt numb and indifferent, but I said yes. I decided to commit, to throw myself into it.
On the first or second day in Canada, we stayed with our grandparents. Grandma took us to a pool in a friend’s backyard — the same pool we used to go to in the summer as kids.
My grandma took each of us for a short personal conversation on the side, and when I started talking to her, I quickly began to open up. Maybe committing to the trip gave me some energy. Maybe it was the nostalgia too. Something in me cracked. I started telling her about the depression. About how I sit at home, smoking all day, doing nothing.
I remember her standing in front of me, looking deep into my eyes. I saw tears in her eyes, and then —
“Tully,” she said to me, “you’re really suffering.”
Something about that sentence — the way she said it — hit me like an injection. I felt it almost spread through me, in real time.
When we got back to the house, I went to my room and broke down. I cried. Hard. Everything came out — years of pain I had forgotten I was carrying.
I hadn’t even realized until then that I was suffering. I hadn’t really looked at it that way. My grandma’s simple, non-judgmental recognition shattered everything. I saw myself through eyes full of compassion. Poor me. I realized how much I had really been hurting. I really felt lonely, scared and broken.
While I was sobbing, I could feel something shifting—like a heavy weight lifting off me. I remember thinking, I don’t want to cry alone. I want a hug. And then I thought — why not just keep talking to Grandma?
So I asked her if we could continue talking. She took me to her session room. I kept crying — deep crying, like a little child, from the gut. I just let it all out. And she sat with me, present, holding the space.
Since then, we’ve been having regular spiritual sessions — once a month, for six years straight. My grandma is a spiritual director. And she’s also an emotional genius.
That moment released so much pain from me. It really did me good. I started to feel more alive, to enjoy my time in Canada with my family. And I decided: when I get back to Israel, I’m going to try to make a change. I’ll eat healthy. Cut down on the weed — maybe even quit. Start working out, and maybe even consider going back to tech.



## Back to Israel

One word that stayed with me from the trip to Canada was “presence.”
“To be present.”

I remember my grandma mentioned it once, and later one of my uncle’s friends talked about it at dinner. We were sitting outside, maybe smoking some weed and listening to music, and at some point, my uncle’s friend turned to me. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but it was something like: “Listen to the music... do you hear it? Just be here.”
Something about that touched me. It brought me back to that idea of “being present” that my grandma had talked about.
Something about it sounded strange to me — like, what does it even mean to be present?
Of course I’m present. Duh.
But something in me was intrigued. I felt like they were pointing to something deeper...
When I got back to Israel, I immediately started making changes.
My uncle helped me build a daily routine: healthy eating, exercise, journaling — things like that.
I significantly cut down on smoking — I decided to only smoke in the evenings.
I started looking for ways to be productive. To feel alive.
And it worked. I felt like a new person. With a new kind of energy.

And the idea of presence? It started to take up more space somewhere in the back of my mind. I still didn’t fully understand it, but I became much more present in my life. I started feeling good. Feeling healthy.
I remember one moment in particular, a few days after I got back to Israel. I was sitting on the couch, drinking orange juice. And it was so delicious, I had never experienced the taste of orange juice so intensely and deliciously. And there was something deeper too — something about that moment felt like it was in slow motion. While I was drinking, and feeling this amazing taste of orange juice, I also saw my hand holding the glass and the movement of my hand.

It blew my mind.
I knew something good was brewing inside me.
And in fact, within two weeks of returning to Israel, I completely quit smoking.



## The Full-Time Job of Being Here

One day I was talking to a friend about this whole thing, and he said to me, “If you’re into it, read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.”
I immediately went out and bought the book, and the moment I started reading it, everything changed for me.
Not only was I captivated, I felt like I already half-knew what he was talking about.
When he described what it means to be present, I read it and smiled — I even laughed to myself.
There was something hilarious about how much it spoke to me. I just understood him. I felt it.
I knew exactly what he was talking about.
At that time, I was still unemployed and didn’t want to rush back into work, so I decided to treat this presence thing like a full-time job.

Every second, every minute of my day — I tried to be as present as possible.
Every time I noticed I was deep in thought or swept away by emotions, I gently redirected my attention back to the present moment.

Every time I caught my mind jumping to analyze the past or plan the future, I gently brought my attention back — to the here and now, to my senses. To what I was hearing, seeing, smelling, and the sensations in my body.
In the past, I used to do a bit of meditation — I used Headspace on the bus to work. I didn’t really understand what I was doing, but I actually enjoyed it.
So I built myself a routine:
20 minutes of meditation


20 minutes of journaling


20 minutes of exercise


20 minutes of reading


And I wouldn’t just do this routine once a day — I’d repeat it again and again.
At that time, with all the depth and intensity, I wasn’t looking for some profound spiritual wisdom or complex philosophy.
I wasn’t trying to understand it intellectually.
I read The Power of Now a lot because it felt like meditation. It brought me closer to presence, but the point wasn’t to understand it — I already knew exactly what he meant. I wanted to live it. To feel it.
I also went on tons of walks — which became my favorite kind of meditation.
Just walking down the street, trying to be present. Feeling my body. Feeling the touch of my clothes on my skin. Listening to the sounds. Looking around.

And every time I noticed my attention had drifted, I gently brought it back to my senses and to the simple awareness that I’m alive and conscious of myself. 
Again and again and again.

Sometimes I’d get tired and give myself a few hours off — but I’d quickly return to it. Over and over.

I was a “full-time meditator” — but not in the sense of a monk or a spiritual yogi.
It was more psychological. It was self-help.
I started living a more active and healthy life. I hadn’t gone back to work yet, but I was socially active, challenging myself, trying to grow — not chasing enlightenment, but simply trying to get better, to live.



## The First Breakthrough

It happened while I was journaling.
I was sitting there, just trying to pour it all out — writing down every thought, every judgment that came to mind. I wanted to go as deep as possible. Even thoughts about having thoughts. Thoughts about writing down all my thoughts. Judgments like: What am I even doing? Is this even going to work?
I kept going like that for a while.
And then, suddenly, I noticed this one small thought in the background — a kind of static background noise that had just been sitting there. I could clearly see it had been grabbing part of my attention, but strangely, for some reason, I hadn’t written it down yet.
Even though I had been obsessively writing down every thought that came up — this elusive little thought had slipped under the radar.
But despite not being fully aware of it, it had still been taking up space in my awareness.

And the moment I wrote it down — boom — I felt my sense of presence expand.

It felt like a big part of my attention had been buried deep inside all these half-thoughts, half-feelings, things I wasn’t fully conscious of. But the second I identified them and wrote them down — it opened up a new space in my mind.
And that space — it felt incredible.

I kept writing, going deeper, pouring everything out.
And then, at some point, I lifted my eyes and looked around the room.

I don’t think I had words in my head at that moment.
But if I did, it would’ve been something like:
No way. Fuck.

It was like my reality had just gotten an upgrade to GTA 6 with the press of a button.

I looked at the sink. The dishes. The soap.
Everything looked like someone had hit the "pause" button in a video game —
everything was frozen in a perfect moment.
Not frozen like a statue — more like motion caught mid-action, full of life and self-awareness.
The soap stood mid-movement, like it was holding some impressive yoga pose.
The dishes in the drying rack weren’t just placed there — they looked like a bunch of characters sharing an inside joke only they understood.
Suddenly, these weren’t just “objects” — it was a scene. Designed. Positioned. Intentional.
Everything looked both hilarious and breathtakingly beautiful at the same time.
In those moments I felt like all my attention had completely left my head — all the usual thoughts and interpretations that quietly suck up most of my attention — and my whole focus shifted to my senses, to my body, and to the simple, deep feeling of I exist, I’m alive.

It was like going from watching a blurry 360p video to seeing in sharp 4K.
And it wasn’t just my vision — my hearing leveled up too. It felt like I had invisible AirPods in my ears on noise-canceling mode, and suddenly — boom — transparency mode.

I could hear everything!
And not just hear — I felt it.

Everything sounded delicious. Beautiful.
Every sound felt like it was emerging from this vast silence — in the most creative, most playful way.
Even distant car horns didn’t sound loud or annoying.
They felt like whispers.
There was this strange quiet behind all the noise — a stillness that made everything soft and perfect.
At that moment, I knew I was experiencing something big.
This is exactly what Eckhart Tolle talked about in The Power of Now.



## The New Tully

After that radical experience, I dove in even deeper — I was laser-focused.

Woke up in the morning and rolled in bed? Trying to be present.
Brushing my teeth? Trying to be present.
Talking to friends? Listening? Trying to be present.

Every single moment became another opportunity to deepen my presence. Every time I noticed myself drifting into the seductive world of thoughts, I gently brought my attention back to the present moment. Over and over again, I chose to prioritize my senses, my body — above the endless stories, identities, and interpretations in my head.
I was obsessed.
This was my full time job now.
To be present. To be aware. Every moment. Every second.
And those moments of deep presence kept showing up.
They grew.
Many of the breakthroughs happened while walking.
But I had no control over them — they just happened.
They would usually catch me while walking, writing, or reading.
And suddenly — boom:
No way. It’s happening again.
It was clear to me that these states of consciousness were totally different from anything I had ever experienced.
It felt like waking up from a dream.
And I mean that literally.
Most of us go through our lives in a kind of sleep — and every time I “woke up,” it felt amazing. Ecstatic. 
It felt like everything.
In those first few months, they came every few days — a radical breakthrough that lasted a few minutes, sometimes even an hour or two.
And in those moments, I was here.
Present.
Continuously aware of myself and my existence, moment to moment.
Interestingly, that awareness didn’t take up mental space or feel heavy — to the contrary, it created space. I realized how much my mind is actually capable of holding — how much sensory input I can absorb at once — when I’m not wasting all my attention chewing on endless thoughts.
It’s not that the thoughts stopped. They still came.
But I wasn’t a prisoner of them anymore.
Even if one caught me for a few seconds, I’d notice it.
I could see where the thought began.
What the trigger was that set it off.
See how long it held me.
And see how in those moments, I forgot that I even existed.
Then I’d smile — and gently return my attention to the reality happening in front of me, in this moment.
And sometimes — for minutes at a time, or more — I was in that zone.
Completely present.
Even if I got lost in thought for a few seconds, the thoughts didn’t have much grip on me.
These moments came every few days.
I couldn’t force them. I couldn’t schedule them.
All I could do was keep trying to be present, moment by moment — and I knew they would come.
Even when they didn’t happen, I was probably more present and aware than I’d ever been before.
But when they did happen — they were something entirely different.
Like connecting to a completely different reality.
Like waking up from a dream.



## The Restaurant Comes to Life

One time I was sitting in a crowded restaurant with friends.
The place was noisy, packed with people.

As always, I was trying to stay present, catching myself every time my attention drifted.
But for the most part, I was in the usual state — semi-asleep.

And then suddenly — boom.
It happened again.

All the thoughts, identities, and stories that usually take up so much space — just vanished.

My senses sharpened like crazy.
It was like the whole background got upgraded to 3D.
Like a video buffering from low resolution to full HD—pixel by pixel.
I looked around—and it was all there. Everything.

The bar. The glasses. The whiskey bottles. The shelves. The pictures on the wall. The people at the table next to us.
Every single thing was vivid, alive, and precise — both on its own and as part of the whole scene.
It wasn’t just clarity — it was depth, almost too much to take in.
And yet, it all flowed into me.

It was ecstasy. Unreal.
And I was aware that I was alive.
Like:

Here I am. Awake again inside the Matrix.
Is anyone else seeing this?!
Is anyone else awake?!



## Intense Moments of Presence

One of the most powerful moments of presence I ever experienced was while cleaning my room.
I’ve always had a thing about cleaning.
When my thoughts get organized — the outer space wants to reflect that, and vice versa.
Every wipe, every movement, every moment made me more and more present.
Until it became overwhelming.

Tears of joy welled up in my eyes.
An immense feeling of gratitude.
I looked around the room, the mirror, the light — and I wanted to cry, because it was all so unbelievably beautiful.

Just the fact that I exist.
That existence even exists — happening right in front of my eyes, right now.
That alone was enough to make me want to fall to my knees, scream, and cry out of pure love, ecstasy, and gratitude.
I remember another time when I was doing the dishes — just trying to be present.
The repetitive movement helped — it brought my mind into rhythm.
Music was playing in the background.
And then it hit me again.
I became present.

Suddenly the music turned into some kind of indescribable emotional experience.
I could hear each instrument separately, and also all of them together.
I could hear the space between them. The movement of the chords.
My relative pitch felt exponentially sharper.
What was also interesting was realizing that all this harmony, richness, and structure — had always been there.
But with all the noise of thought, it never reached me.
I hadn’t discovered some higher dimension.
It was just reality — finally clear, sharp. Unbelievable.
The feeling was so strong, so alive,
that I was almost tempted to stop the music right then and there — just to go outside and announce to the world what I had just seen and felt.
It didn’t only come in poetic moments.
Once, in the middle of a migraine — something that usually shuts me down completely — suddenly, even though the pain was there, something deeper opened.
There was a part of me that simply was. Aware. At peace. Unaffected by the migraine.
Another time, I woke up from a nap — and I was just there.
Full presence.
No lead-up.
Just — hello. Here I am again.
In those moments, the world didn’t just look real — it looked designed.
I’d look at a palm tree and immediately think of an upside-down giant broom — it was funny. Everything was full of humor, amusing and playful. I’d look at cars — and they’d smile at me, with their headlights and shapes like cartoon characters from a movie.
Everywhere I looked, everything seemed to share some comedic resemblance.
A joke that only the present moment understands.

Even space itself felt different — the sky felt less distant. Like a painted dome wrapping around us. I’d look up at the sky and see a plane just sitting there, like a toy glued to a painting, and it felt almost like I could reach out and grab it with my hands.

I’d laugh and smile to myself, because it felt like the universe hit "pause" and said:
“Let’s see if anyone notices how weird and amazing everything really is.”



## A Street Walker’s Trip Report

There’s one moment I remember from one of my walks — I had been walking for maybe an hour, trying to stay present.
Doing all the practices, but I just couldn’t quite manage to quiet my mind.
Eventually, I reached the beach.
I gave up.
I sat down.
I pulled out my phone and started watching NBA highlights on YouTube.
I let myself get lost in my phone.
And then — after a minute or two — I looked up toward the horizon — and boom.
There it was again.
Crystal clarity.
All my awareness snapped back into my body and senses.
I was awake again.

I think the walking practice had already quieted my mind for the most part, but I was still caught in some thoughts.
And the moment I allowed myself to drift into YouTube a bit — somehow it released that last grip.
And that freed my attention.
Another time, I was walking down Dizengoff Street, trying to get back to that state — trying to be aware.
It was a struggle.
I managed to quiet my thoughts a little,
but some of them still had a strong grip on me.
Especially thoughts about being aware.
Thoughts about thoughts.
It felt obsessive.
It got to the point where I suddenly thought — maybe I’ve gone too far with this.
Maybe this is dangerous.
Maybe I’m going crazy.
But ironically, that very thought was too extreme...
And then — boom — I woke up again.
Back to presence.
Clarity.
Space.
Silence.
As if my mind accidentally played its final card, which instantly brought me back to that state of heightened sensory consciousness and continuous self-awareness.
I felt weightless.
Walking on my tiptoes through the street.
Wanting to savor every moment, every step, every breath.
And you look around, and you see it.
You see how asleep everyone is.
Trapped in their own minds.
And yeah, they’re kind of noticing you, and their surroundings, but it barely gets in.
And you feel this weird mix—empathy and awe.

On one hand, you think: “Wow, they’re really sleepwalking.”
On the other hand: “Wow, they’re so beautiful!”
Like a movie scene.

It felt as if everyone was already enlightened — they just didn’t know it.
Like, people were playing their roles with so much swag, so much beauty.
Maybe they’re not aware of it.
But they are it.
Sometimes it felt like some mysterious alien was randomly pressing buttons in my brain —
and boom. The world opens up. Everything becomes beautiful.
And then I look around, wondering:
“Wait... what’s going on here? Has everyone been seeing this the whole time?!”
But the alien’s already drifting away, smiling.
Maybe whispering:
“Don’t worry... just be here.”
In those moments, my social anxiety vanished completely.
Because you see clearly that everyone is trapped in their own loops.
It was like becoming lucid in a dream — you start acting playfully, because you realize none of it really matters.
People might look at you.
Might judge you a bit.
But you see how shallow that judgment is.
99% of their attention is still turned inward, on themselves.
It’s a strange feeling, but it doesn’t make you feel disconnected from others — to the contrary, it made me feel love.
I saw the inner child in everyone.
And in myself, too.

I’d make eye contact with someone on the street, and I could see how they noticed me for a split second.
I could see how it probably triggered a few associative thoughts in them, but very quickly — they were swept away again.
Back into the next loop. The next trigger.



## The Scientist and the Experiment

It got to the point where I really felt like a scientist on a mission — trying to dive deeper and deeper into my mind.
Trying not to let my brain fool me.
I was trying to understand how exactly those moments of presence happened —
to capture the mechanics of it, maybe learn how to control them.

Like, if I could only just be aware enough at the very moment presence arrived…
maybe I could study it.
Break it down.
And then maybe find a way to reach it again, on demand.
But it didn’t really work — it was an endless chase.
I also tried to examine myself and my patterns.
I started noticing, for example, different types of fantasy.
Some negative — driven by pain, fear.
And others more seductive — images of success, love, power.
Each state came with its own emotional fuel.
Different situations triggered different circuits.
At some point, I could actually feel my body trying to generate the right emotional charge to sustain a positive fantasy — all while trying to stay present.
But it never really worked.
It’s one of the strangest tricks of the mind —
trying to have the cake and eat it too.
I began to notice patterns.
Social interactions, for example, were some of the hardest times to stay present. Even when I really tried — it just didn’t happen.
The signal couldn’t pierce through all the internal noise, the masks and defenses I had during social interactions.
But sometimes — on the way home, something would open. Gentle, but clear.
As if presence had been waiting backstage — and now it stepped forward, “Hello.”

It was almost as if those states were a side effect of the effort to be aware.
There were also moments that just felt absurdly poetic.
Like suddenly I’d catch the absurdity of it all — how easily I could get lost in distractions without noticing.
Just noticing how lost I had been was sometimes enough to snap me back into the moment:
Wait. I exist.
I’m here.
How did I not notice that?
But it was a never-ending chase.
Even when those moments arrived — they were so strong, so intense —
that it was almost impossible to stay present in them for more than a few minutes.
The beauty, the ecstasy — would sweep me right back into imagination and thought.
One of the most meaningful insights I had was related to ego defense mechanisms.
I discovered that every time my ego took a hit — like if I was rejected —
my mind would immediately, automatically go into fantasy mode.
I’d start imagining the comeback, how I’d succeed, and prove everyone wrong.
I’d never noticed this before.
But it was happening all the time.
One time, for example, during a regular meditative walk, I got a phone call informing me I didn’t get a job I was sure I’d land.
My ego took a hit.
And within seconds — I drifted away into fantasy like:
They’re so dumb. I’ll go back to tech, I’ll crush it, they’ll regret it. You’ll see.
But then — after a minute or two — I woke up.
I saw how I had been swept into the world of thought and fantasy.
And the moment I came back to presence — I saw the entire pattern, happening in real time.
I saw why those thoughts even arose, what triggered them, why I was suddenly in a passionate fantasy.
Suddenly, the whole fantasy didn’t feel so real.
I could let go of the need to keep drifting and bring my attention back to the here and now.
I caught my brain red-handed! — it didn’t know I was watching.
But there was also compassion.
Toward myself.
Toward how the brain was just trying to protect me.
Thoughts are just thoughts.
They’re not aware. They’re not who we are.
The brain just keeps running its usual scripts.
But in moments of true presence — I could see the whole process:
The trigger, the chain of thoughts, the emotional tone, how long I had been lost and forgotten that I exist.
And when you see that — it loses its grip.
The thoughts still arise — but they don’t control you anymore.
They no longer feel “real” or nearly as “urgent” like they used to.
And I could let go.
And that’s one of the wildest things about radical presence practice:
It feels like a battle with your own mind.
And your mind is so clever — most of the time, you believe you’re the thinking brain, “I think, therefore I am.”
But when you’re truly present — and the brain keeps spinning, pulled by internal and external associative triggers —
it reveals itself, because it doesn’t know you’re aware.

And yet, it recovers quickly.
It tries to merge with your “higher self.”
To stay relevant.
You start seeing how cunning the mind really is.
How it tries to take credit.
How it tries to hijack even the desire to be present.
Think about it:
Even the part of us that wants to be present —
That's just another thought.

Maybe you can reach enlightenment.
But the “you” that longs for presence won’t be there when it happens.
And that slowly helped me understand — this is lifelong work.
You never “control” the mind.
You just keep remembering, again and again.
You remember you exist and got lost — and you can gently smile, feel a sense of relief, and return to your senses and your body.
I started to realize more that in my ordinary state of consciousness —
almost every thought or emotion that arises takes up all of my attention —
To the point that I totally forget I even exist.
Every thought feels like the most important and real thing in the world.
It feels impossible to let it go — because it feels like letting go of myself.
But the brain jumps from thought to thought, usually triggered by small associations.
For example: you’re walking down the street and see someone who reminds you of someone — and suddenly, within 10–15 seconds, you’re deep into a story of worry or fantasy that could last minutes or hours.
One thought leads to another — and it all feels so necessary, important.
Like, “I’m not just thinking about this randomly — it’s important.”
“If I let it go, what if I forget? Am I supposed to become passive in life now?”
But in our default state, we don’t even know what’s driving us.
Why did we even start thinking that story that now feels so urgent — we’re like puppets pulled by inner and outer strings.
But in moments of presence — you see it.
You see where it started, what the trigger was, how one thought pulled another.
You see how every thought manages, again and again, to suck in all your attention as if it’s the most crucial, urgent thing in the world.
And when you see this whole event happening in real time, or a few seconds later — you can easily release the thought with a smile, like:
“Ahhh, right!”
Forgot I exist again. Got swept away again.
And gently return to just being.



## The Inner Compass

One of the things that developed in me during that time was a sort of inner compass — a kind of awareness tracker.
A new manager whose job was to notice whenever I got swept into the world of thoughts, imagination, and emotion — and wake me up.

This compass, this inner alarm clock — became a central part of my existence.

And it wasn’t just an alarm.
It was like I had a background process running almost all the time, scanning the quality of the sensory input coming in and the level of noise or stillness in my mind, in order to measure how awake I was at any given moment.
It wasn’t just about whether I was present or not — but how present I was.
How much space I had in my mind.
And it wasn’t something I had to think about — it became second nature.

A system running in the background, constantly checking:
Where am I now?
How clear is this moment?

But at times, it was also exhausting and burdensome.
Once you experience that upgraded state of awareness— even just once — you start to feel asleep every time you’re not there, and you keep trying to wake up — which can be draining.

Sometimes it felt like being in a boring lecture I was desperately trying not to fall asleep in — but I was just too tired.
Fall asleep, wake up.
Again.
And again.
Tired.
It’s important for me to emphasize this — because there’s a price to pay.
And it can even be potentially dangerous.
You are diving deep into your own mind.
You are operating on yourself.
And it’s a little scary.
Because once you start seeing how your mind actually works —
you also see how easily it can deceive you.
How easy it is to forget.
How easy it is to get lost.
One trick I remember my mind played on me happened during a moment of pure presence.
While walking, when I could feel the continuity of my existence from moment to moment, a thought suddenly passed through my head: “Maybe my purpose is to wake everyone up?”
In the first few seconds, it didn’t feel extreme or weird — even a little inspiring.
But then, after half a minute or so, I woke up again, and saw it for what it was — just another clever trick by my mind to create a compelling narrative to subtly pull my attention away from life itself, happening right in front of me at that very moment.

The mind will do anything to stay in charge and to seduce us into the realm of imagination and thought.
That’s why many people say it’s best to do this kind of work in a group, or with a teacher —
because the mind is just too sneaky to handle alone.

And eventually I did join a few groups.
Spiritual groups. Meditation groups. A Gurdjieff group.
But honestly, I didn’t really connect with any of them.
Everything felt too structured, too ritualistic, or too naive.
But still — it did help me.
At least in the sense of challenging myself, giving myself more opportunities to practice presence in those unique social settings.



## How Far Am I from Enlightenment?

During those months, I really believed I was probably just weeks — or maybe a few short months — away from enlightenment.
What I thought that meant was: being in that state of presence all the time, or at least most of the time.
Or at least knowing how to enter it whenever I wanted, after a few minutes of meditation.
I read Eckhart Tolle, and later on teachers like Mooji and Gurdjieff.
And they all made it sound like it was possible to turn that into a permanent state.
And I was like — yeah, I’m pretty close. Maybe I really am “the one”...
Today, looking back — my perspective has shifted.
These days I connect much more with spiritual teachings that are grounded.
More realistic.

My grandma once told me:
“If you can be present for ten minutes a day — that’s amazing.”
That sentence stuck with me.

Listening to and reading people like Ram Dass and Alan Watts also helped me understand more — that this state isn’t something you can expect to control.
Certainly not in the middle of a busy, full life.
And there’s a certain comfort in that too.
I remember one insight that came to me after the high of presence had faded:

“Maybe being enlightened... is not being enlightened after all...”

Maybe it’s just... what it is.
You try to be present.
If you succeed — great.
And if you don’t — also great.
And if you’re not into spirituality or consciousness at all — also great.

My grandma also often says that God is found in the darkness too, not just in the light.
That presence isn’t only in moments of ecstasy.
It’s also being aware in moments of struggle — confusion, overwhelm.
At first, honestly, I had a hard time connecting with that.
In my early experience, presence was always accompanied by some sense of ecstasy and intense excitement.
So I didn’t really understand what she meant.
But lately, I think I’m starting to get it more.
I’ve had moments of deeper awareness — moments when I understood that, fundamentally, everything is okay.
Even if on the surface things are hard, maybe my body hurts, maybe I’m sad, feeling disgusted, whatever it is...
There’s a part of me that sees that even when I feel difficult emotions — it’s not that bad.
I’m still okay.
This life is still wild and incredible, despite everything.
Lately, I’ve had moments where I stopped worrying about the fact that I was worrying.
Where I stopped resisting everything I was feeling — because it just... wasn’t that bad.

I think awareness is probably an infinite space.
And every time even a little room opens up — it feels amazing. Expansive.



## Psychedelics and Spiritual Content

In the first months of this journey, I wasn’t trying to accumulate spiritual knowledge or consume spiritual content at all.
As far as I was concerned, I already understood everything.
It was that simple:
Try to be present in every moment.
When I noticed I was drifting into thoughts about the past or future, I gently brought my attention back to the present moment.
That was the whole shtick.
Later, when the sense of presence started to fade —
and I felt less connected — that’s when I began exploring spiritual content.
And later on, psychedelics too.
But during those first few months, there was simply no need.
When I eventually did try psychedelics — like LSD, MDMA, DMT —
It came from a desire to reconnect.
I wasn’t looking to discover something new.
Just to experience a trailer, a taste, a reminder — something to bring me back to a place I already knew.
And yes, sometimes under the influence, I did feel present.
There were powerful moments, no doubt.
But still — none of those substances came close to what I had experienced in natural states of presence.
The drugs felt like energy.
Something intense from within.
As if they opened or amplified something with force.
But that energy — it wasn’t presence.
For me, it wasn’t about how powerful the experience was.
The real question was:
Am I truly present? Am I aware?
And no matter how intense or deep the experience —
it didn’t necessarily bring me any closer to that.



## Objective Truth

When it comes to questions about God, or having an objective understanding of the universe, afterlife, or whatever —
I can’t say I saw anything absolute or objective in those moments.

But it did shape the way I think about life.
It inspired me to connect with new ideas about how I see the universe and myself.

That everything is one, that everything is consciousness.
But did I see that clearly in those moments? No.

It did resonate deeply with what I experienced, though, and it definitely inspired me to connect with the idea that life and the universe are like God playing hide and seek with Himself — that all that exists is just consciousness and God, and we simply forgot who we are.
We forgot that we are God. We’re pretending not to be.
Even the idea of life after death suddenly felt interesting and not far-fetched — it made more sense that consciousness might potentially continue to exist after the physical body dies.
But I’m not sure about that, or what it means.
Those ideas weren’t part of the experience itself.
So those moments didn’t explain to me how the universe works,
or reveal some objective truth — but intuitively, I deeply resonated with the idea that the only thing that truly exists is awareness — and that we’re all awareness, we’re all God, we just forgot.
Also when I’m outside the experience — like now, for example — yes, I can come back with certain memories, words to describe it, but I’m not in it. And when you’re not in it — you’re not fully aware, so I can’t really remember exactly what was there.
But the good news is, like with regular sleep — every time you wake up, you remember everything:
Who you are, Where you are, What you dreamed.
So it's kinda the same here.
The experience itself resembled something I later read in Ouspensky’s books — the “third state of consciousness.”
Ouspensky writes that humans have four different states of consciousness: sleep, waking, self-remembering, and objective consciousness.
What I experienced was the third state — self-remembering — which he says also activates emotions that are far stronger than those in our ordinary state.
It’s a state where you are fully present and aware of your own existence moment by moment — not as a thought, but truly aware.
Ouspensky said it’s like those rare moments in life where you suddenly feel, out of nowhere:

“Wow, how strange — I exist. And I am right here, right now.”

It happens to us naturally on rare occasions — maybe during great trauma or extremely significant life moments, when suddenly the thoughts stop and you’re completely present — in your body, in your senses, aware that you exist.

These are those big moments in life where people like to ask:
“Where were you when you heard about…?”

We remember those moments much more vividly.

Most of our memories are layers of memories built up over the years.
We know something happened, but we can’t really feel what it was like back then.
But then there are those rare moments where we remember exactly where we were, what it smelled like, how it felt — something we’ll never forget.
These are moments or sparks of self-remembering.
And they’re not only vivid in real-time — they also leave a stronger imprint in memory.
Not just about what happened in that moment, but maybe also what led up to it.
Like when we wake up, and in those first seconds we can remember what we dreamt and register it.. Same thing here…
This experience also changed how I view religion.
You suddenly realize — that’s actually the whole point of religion.
But most people have no clue.
Another reason it made me think of awareness as God is because I grew up in a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) background,
and from a young age I was taught to believe in God and in Judaism.
And even though I believed in God — because it’s drilled into you so strongly like:
“Of course God exists and Judaism is the truth, and anyone who thinks otherwise is silly…”
Or — “You really think you’re smarter than all the great Jewish philosophers? Just because you have a few ‘hard’ questions?”
Or — “Are you really willing to risk being wrong and ending up in hell?”

And it worked on me to some extent.
But even faith wasn’t enough for me to feel connected to Judaism and religion. I was in confilct with God like:
“Screw you, God, I am not listening to you, God... what are you going to do about it? Let’s see…”
Or — “Why are you God and not me? That’s not fair.”
But now, from this new perspective — I’ve found a new way to connect to God — as my inner self.
I don’t have someone external to complain to about why He did this or where He was during the Holocaust — because God isn’t something outside of us. We are God, all of us, everything that exists — we just forgot.
So in a way, we put ourselves in this situation.

But I’m not claiming this as an objective fact. I just resonate with it.
The beauty of it is that once you see presence and awareness as your true self — not your thoughts or emotions, but something deeper that’s just observing and aware of everything — all those big abstract questions about life stop being important:
“Does God exist?”
“What happens after death?”
Those are just more thoughts — more content to be aware of.
Your priorities shift from those abstract life questions to what is happening right now in this moment of this life in front of me.
Am I aware that I exist, that the universe exists...?
All the other questions or thoughts feel less important.
So it gave me a new way to understand God — from a surprising angle.



## The Need to Share

The urge to share and show people what I had discovered was really strong — like:
“You don’t understand what’s going on here! You have to see this!”
But it was also frustrating.
Because most of the people around me — friends, family, whoever — it felt like they were bored by it or didn’t really get what the hype was about.
And then you start to realize — most people, at least in their day-to-day lives, just aren’t interested.
It sounds too hippie to them, boring.
I think a lot of people might reach this, like me, through a crisis.
You reach such a low point in life that you’ve got nothing left to lose — and then it becomes easier to let go of that annoying invisible helmet we all carry, the one that filters the world without us even realizing.
Because once you let go, there’s no pressure, and nothing left to lose.
But for people who don’t suffer much emotionally, or who are less emotionally or intuitively connected — what’s their motivation to try to be present?

Most of us think we already are present, more or less — or at least we can be, if we want.
So why put in effort into something you think you already have?

Sometimes I feel like shouting to everyone:
“You have no idea what you’re missing!”
It’s not some preachy moral thing or peace-and-love fluff.
It’s the actual software behind the story.
It’s ecstasy.
It’s mind blowing.

There were times I really felt a strong urge to go up to people — friends, strangers, didn’t matter — and gently touch their hand and say:
“Hey. Can you hear this? Can you hear this insane silence?”
I wanted to physically transfer them into a state of awareness.
To long-press on their invisible AirPods — and flip them into transparency mode.
To let the silence in. Let the world in.
Not to teach.
Not to preach.
Just to share. To transmit the feeling. The shift.
It fascinates me — just like AI fascinates me. Or technology. Or anything in life that’s truly fascinating.
And it makes you realize the insane potential of our brain — like, what else is this crazy human brain capable of experiencing? Probably way more than I’ve encountered.
Especially since Gurdjieff and Ouspensky talk about this even higher state of consciousness — the fourth state — objective consciousness.

A Question for the Reader: How Far Are You Willing to Go?
I’m not trying to claim there’s only one way to reach these states of consciousness. Sometimes, they just catch us off guard.
Rare flashes where everything feels still, real, undeniable.
Maybe during a special moment while traveling, or a major life event, and suddenly — boom — out of nowhere, we wake up for a moment.
The endless mental noise pauses briefly, and we’re just here, existing, present.
Most of us experience only a handful of such moments in our lives.
Special moments that stay with us — like bookmarks we never meant to place.
But if we’re talking about trying to bring these moments into our everyday lives, then my question to you is:
How far are you willing to go?
Me , as I shared, treated it like a full-time job.
Not as a concept — but as a constant practice.
To check, again and again, in every moment I remembered, where my precious attention is residing. 
And it’s not a simple commitment — our thinking mind will always try to pull us away.
“Okay, I’ll get out of bed and do a bit of meditation.”

But that’s just another trick of the mind, trying to distract us from the miracle unfolding right in front of our eyes, right now.

Presence isn’t later, it’s not a goal to achieve in the future.

It’s now.

On the way from the bed to the couch — that’s where the magic is, right now.
To feel the floor beneath your feet.
To hear the background noises.
And it’s not that the thoughts and identities disappear — they’re still there — but the priorities shift.
The raw experience of what’s happening in this moment, through our senses and our basic, simple awareness of existence — that becomes the main thing.
I’m not gonna sugarcoat it, living this way —  requires SURRENDER.

But it doesn’t mean giving up on life —
but giving up the need to micromanage every little detail of our lives, especially internally, in our thoughts and emotions.
Just gently allowing things to be as they are.

And yes, it’s scary — it feels like if we let go even for a second, everything might fall apart.
But what I discovered is that when you’re willing to let go — even for a short while — of that inner commentator, of every thought that feels so urgent and important, you find that instead of pulling you away from life, it lands you deeper into life than you ever imagined possible.

You’re not escaping or withdrawing inward — you’re open, and alive.



## The Medication’s Role

I don’t really know how much of an impact the Sertraline (Zoloft) had on this whole process.
I used it intermittently until I decided to stop.
And even long after I stopped, I continued to experience some of the breakthroughs — but I know it played a part too.
The way I see it, it primarily gave me the initial energy I needed to be able to do the necessary inner work and to escape the paradox of depression —
"If you exercise and stay active, you’ll feel better — but how can I even find the strength to exercise when I’m depressed?"
Today, I no longer use medication.
Maybe I’ll consider it again in the future, maybe not.

One reason I’m mentioning this is because I truly believe that some kind of special energy is needed in order to be present and to engage in these mind exercises.
You can generate that energy by finding ways to challenge yourself, step outside your comfort zone, live a healthy life, exercise — all of that alongside and within the practice itself.

You can’t just force the mind into enlightenment or presence through willpower or decision alone.

It’s like trying to run a marathon without being in shape, and saying:
"I have enough willpower — I’ll just keep running, I won’t quit."
But we all know it doesn’t work like that.
It’s impossible.
You’ll give up — or collapse.
Same with presence.
It requires inner work.
For me, at the beginning, the medication was part of that.
And honestly, it’s a little annoying. It’s a hit to the ego.
Like maybe I didn’t really create this myself.
But either way — not all of those moments happened while I was on medication.



## The Fading, the Return to Routine

Eventually, after several months, it slowly began to fade.
But it didn’t fade without leaving a mark.
It left a profound shift in how I see life — and how I see myself.
It left memories.
Tiny sparks.
Sometimes, when I go out for walks, it suddenly returns for a moment —
just a flicker.
And I remember how it felt — what it was.
The inner compass and the alarm clock are still there too, even if I can’t always hear them through all the stress and noise in my head.
Over time, as those experiences faded more and more, most of the time I’m pretty skeptical if they’ll ever come back.
But even if they don’t — this life is still insane.
And honestly?
It felt like it was worth an entire lifetime — the good, the bad, the highs and the lows — just to experience a few of those moments. It was worth everything.
The memories it gave me, the insights, the hope, the meaning.
It was an experience that changed my life.
But yes, it did fade — especially after I returned to tech and the daily grind.



## Where Am I Stand Today?

Today, three and a half years after returning to tech, here I am again — back in the same place.
Once again addicted to weed, once again I’ve quit my job.
The work became really difficult for me, and I took everything very personally.
That, combined with the weed addiction and thoughts about life — that I don’t want to be a slave to routine and my bosses — brought me to a point where I felt I just couldn’t go on anymore. So I left.
But this time is different.
First of all, I’m proud of myself for lasting three and a half years at the same job — that’s no small thing.
And even though I quit again — partly because of a crisis and the addiction — this time, it’s a significant step forward from the last time.
I no longer see myself as being in depression —
Sometimes I do feel low-energy, but it’s not the same kind of depression I had in the past.
This time, I planned my exit more intentionally.
I decided to take a few months to try and reset.
To see what the world has to offer me.
Maybe I can find another source of income that isn’t programming and endless tech deadlines.
Maybe I can live more through my passions and strengths.
In software engineering, even though I’m pretty good at it, it never really felt like “me.”
I always try to use my emotional and intuitive skills to get through everything in life, no matter what — even analytical things.
And if that’s who I am — an observer, a pattern-seeker, someone who tries to understand himself and everyone — then maybe I can find something that fits better with my personality and skills.
Ironically, since I left my job — presence has started to return to my life a little.
Not grand breakthroughs — but something subtle.
It’s like all this time I hadn’t heard the inner alarm clock because of all the stress and routine — but now I’m clearly hearing that inner call again. And I want to do something with it.

I feel like this is my shtick.
I want to be a philosopher, to explore consciousness through myself, to be the scientist and the experiment.
To live this way as much as I can and report back to the world what I’ve seen and understood.
I don’t yet know how — or if I have the discipline to make a meaningful change in my life — but what I do know is:

My first wave of awakening — was real.
And I feel like I may be approaching a potential second wave.
And given that it will be built on the first wave —
on all the insights, realizations, and life experiences I’ve had so far —
who knows... maybe it will go even deeper than the first.



## A Flare In The Sky

Am I crazy for feeling like I could be some kind of “consciousness scientist” —
where I’m both the scientist and the experiment?

I’m not looking to preach.
I don’t want to change anyone or even heal anyone.
I just want to understand — myself. The world. Everything.

I know how to report what I’ve seen —
I can’t fully explain it or completely understand it when I’m not in it,
but I’ve seen enough to come and say to you:
Guys, I have to tell you what happened and what I discovered.

I was there.
I was here.

And I want to leave a mark in the sand — fire a flare into the sky, and say to the world:

This is me.
I was here.
I was present.
I tried.

I’ve thought about different ways to share my journey — maybe I’ll try creating a kind of inner travel journal.
A testimony from the edges of awareness.
Maybe I’ll turn it into a book.
Maybe I’ll post short pieces online.
Maybe a blog.
I have no idea.
But I feel like my experiences and my voice have a some value in the world —
like a personal witness statement.
A report from a consciousness journey.
Like I said, I don’t yet know where I’m going from here.
But there’s one last thing I want to say:

I saw something.

I was there.

And I’m not going to stay quiet about it anymore — at least not this one time.

I’m here to report what I saw.

And I think I’m going back in.

You coming?!
