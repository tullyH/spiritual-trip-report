# What I Saw When I Woke Up: Notes from the First Wave - A Spiritual Trip Report by Tully Hoffmann


## Tully, You Are Really Suffering

Sometimes, you gotta hit rock bottom to make a change.
In February 2019, I quit my job in tech. I was working as a software engineer, but I was deep in a weed addiction—and that was a big part of why I left. I had some money saved, and honestly, I’d just had enough of life. I wasn’t suicidal—I just wanted to numb out. To smoke, to scroll, to watch myself disappear.
For months, that’s what I did. I stayed home, smoking weed all day, watching porn, YouTube, reality TV—anything to pass the time. Anything to disappear. Anything to not exist.
I isolated myself as much as possible. Barely answered messages. Kept contact with the outside world to a minimum.
During that time, I started seeing a therapist, which I actually liked. But that was about it. Eventually, my psychologist recommended I see a psychiatrist, who suggested I try 50mg of Zoloft. I didn’t resist—I was at such a low point, I had nothing to lose.
A few weeks later, my sister asked if I wanted to come with her to visit Canada. I still felt numb, but I said yes. I’d just commit. Throw myself into it.
On the first or second day there, we were staying with our grandparents. My grandma took us to a friend’s backyard pool—the same one we used to swim in as kids during the summers.
I remember standing by the pool with her and starting to open up.
Throwing myself into the trip gave me some energy. Maybe it was that. Maybe it was nostalgia. Either way, something cracked open. I started telling her about the depression. About how I’d been sitting at home, smoking all day, doing nothing.
She looked at me, and her eyes filled with tears.
“Tully,” she said, “you are really suffering.”
And something about that sentence—something in the way she said it—hit me like an injection. I felt it working inside me in real time, like it was spreading.
Back at the house, I went to my room and broke down. I cried. Hard. Everything came pouring out—years of pain I didn’t even know I was holding.
Apparently, all it took was one “Tully, you are really suffering”—and I opened up like a flower.
I don’t think I’d even realized I was suffering. I hadn’t looked at it that way. And suddenly, I did. I saw myself with so much empathy. Poor me. I really was hurting. I really felt alone, frightened, and broken.
As I was sobbing, I could feel something shifting—like a heavy weight lifting off me. I thought, I don’t want to cry alone. I want to be hugged. Then I thought, Why not just keep talking to my grandma?
So I asked if we could talk. She took me into her session room. I kept crying—like a little kid, from deep in my stomach. I totally let go. Just let it pour out. And my grandma sat there with me, holding the space, completely present.
Since that day, we’ve been doing spiritual sessions together—once a month, for the last six years and counting. My grandma is a Spiritual Director. She’s also an emotional genius.
That moment lifted so much weight off me. It made me feel better. I started actually enjoying my time in Canada with my family. And I decided: when I get back to Israel, I’m gonna try. I’m gonna eat healthy. Cut back on weed—maybe quit. Work out. Maybe even consider going back to tech.


## Back To Israel

One word that struck me during that trip to Canada was “Presence.”
“Being present.”
I remember my grandma mentioning it once, and one of my uncle’s friends brought it up over dinner. We were sitting outside, maybe smoking some weed and listening to music, and at one point, my uncle’s friend turned to me. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but it was something like, “Listen to the music… you hear that? Are you here?”
There was something very slow-motion and correct about what she was saying. It reminded me of the “being present” shtick my grandma had mentioned.
Something about it sounded weird—like, what does being present even mean?
Of course I’m present. Duh.
But part of me was curious. I knew there was something they were pointing at…
Back in Israel, right after I came back, I started making changes. My uncle helped me build a daily routine: eating healthy, working out, journaling, that.
I cut down on weed—decided I’d only smoke in the evenings. I started exercising and looking for ways to be productive. To feel alive.
It was working. I felt like a new person. New energy.
And the idea of being present? It started taking up more space in the back of my mind. I didn’t fully realize it yet, but I was becoming way more present in my life. I was starting to feel good. To feel healthy.
I remember one moment—sitting on the couch, drinking orange juice. And it was so insanely delicious. I had never felt so present in the taste of something before. It blew my mind.
I knew something was cooking in me.
Within two weeks, I quit weed completely.


## The Full-Time Job of Being Here

One day, I was talking to a friend about all this, and he said, “If you’re into presence, read The Power of Now.”
So I bought the book. And it changed everything.
I started reading it—and not only was it fascinating, it felt like I already knew exactly what he was talking about. The way he described being present—I was reading and smiling, even laughing to myself. There was something hilarious about how much I connected to it. I just knew what he was saying. I felt it.
I knew exactly what he meant.
At that point, I was still unemployed and didn’t feel like rushing back into tech, so I started treating this presence thing like a full-time job.
Every second, every minute, I tried to be as present as possible.
Every time I noticed my thoughts drifting or my feelings pulling me somewhere else, I gently brought my attention back to the present moment.
Whenever my mind jumped into the past or future, I pulled it back—to the here and now, to my senses, to the sounds I heard, what I saw, the feeling in my body.
I’d done a little meditation before. I used to use a meditation app on the way to work. I didn’t fully get it, but I kind of liked it.
So I came up with a routine:
20 minutes of meditation


20 minutes of journaling


20 minutes of working out


20 minutes of reading


And here’s the thing—at this point, even with all that intensity, I wasn’t actually looking for spiritual knowledge or some deep philosophy. I wasn’t trying to figure it out intellectually.
I was reading The Power of Now because it felt like a meditation. It brought me closer to presence. It wasn’t about ideas—I already understood what he was talking about. I felt it.
I was on a mission to be as present as possible in every moment.
I’d do that routine multiple times a day.
And I walked a lot—which became my favorite meditative practice.
Walking down the street, just trying to be present. Feeling my body. Noticing how my clothes felt on my skin. Listening to the sounds. Looking around.
And every time my attention drifted, I gently brought it back to now.
This became my full-time job. Sometimes I got tired and let go for a few hours—but then I’d come right back to it. Again and again.
I was a full-time meditator.
But it wasn’t some monk, spiritual, yogi thing.
This was psychological. This was self-help.
I was living an active, healthy life. I wasn’t ready to go back to work, but I was socially active, doing stuff, challenging myself, trying to grow—not just to chase enlightenment, but to improve.


## The First Breakthrough

I think the first breakthrough happened while journaling.
One time, I was sitting down, just trying to spill—writing every thought, every judgment that came into my mind. I wanted to go as deep as possible. Even the thought of having a thought. The thoughts about writing every thought. The judgment of what am I even doing and will this work?
I kept going like that for a while.
Then suddenly, I noticed one little thought in the background—clearly taking up some of my attention, but I hadn’t written it down yet.
Even though I was obsessively writing every thought that came up, this one had gone unnoticed.
It was like I wasn’t fully aware of it, but it had been quietly hijacking a chunk of my attention.
And the moment I wrote it down—boom—I felt my presence expand.
It was like my attention had been occupied by these half-thought, half-feeling things. I hadn’t been conscious of them, but acknowledging one—writing it down—made space.
And that space felt amazing.
I kept going, letting thoughts pour out.
Then, at one point, I lifted my eyes and looked around the room.
I don’t think there were any words in my head at that moment.
But if there was a thought, it was just:
No way. Holy shit.
It was like my reality got upgraded to GTA 6 at the press of a button.
I looked at the sink. The dishes. The soap.
And it was like the whole environment had just hit pause—
like a simulation glitched mid-frame, and everything froze in perfect stillness.
But not stiff—more like intentional. Like everything had been captured right in the middle of its movement, completely owning its place in space.
The soap stood mid-motion like it was holding a yoga pose in some divine photoshoot.
The plates in the dish rack weren’t just stacked—they were together. Like a group of characters in on some joke.
Suddenly, it wasn’t just “stuff”—it was a scene. Designed. Positioned. Intentional.
Everything looked hilarious and beautiful at the same time.
My attention had completely shifted.
Out of my mind. Out of my normal emotions.
Fully into my body. Into my senses.
It was like going from 360p to 4K vision.
Like I’d had invisible AirPods in with noise canceling on, and now—boom—transparency mode.
I could hear everything.
And not just hear it—feel it.
Everything sounded crunchy. Delicious. Like each sound was rising up from silence in the most artistic, playful way.
It felt like there was this vast, silent space underneath reality, and all the sounds were bubbling out of it—cool, smooth, funny, crunchy.
Even background honking didn’t feel loud or invasive.
It was like a whisper.
There was this strange silence behind the noise that made everything feel soft and perfect.
In that moment, I knew I was experiencing something big.
That’s what Tolle was talking about.


## The New Tully

I was a man on a mission: be present in every moment.
Wake up? Be present.
Roll over in bed? Be present.
Brush your teeth? Be present.
Talk to a friend? Listen. Be present.
I was obsessed.
This was my full-time job now.
Be present. Be aware. Every moment. Every second.
And those moments of deep presence kept coming.
They grew.
And there were so many different ways to describe them.
So many things I learned about myself in them.
A lot of the breakthroughs happened while I was walking.
And here’s the wild part—I had no control over those moments.
They just happened.
Later, I realized—even when I didn’t feel “in the zone,” I was still pretty damn present.
But then came those real moments.
The spontaneous ones.
They’d hit while I was walking. Or writing. Or reading.
And suddenly:
Noo wayyyy. Here we go again.
It became clear that these states were radically different from anything I’d experienced before.
It really was like waking up from a dream.
And I mean that literally.
Most of us are dream-walking through life—and I had just woken up.
It felt incredible.
It felt ecstatic.
It felt like everything.
And honestly? I chased those moments.
Hard.
In the first few months, they’d come every few days—a radical breakthrough that would last a few minutes, sometimes even an hour or two.
And in those moments, I was here.
I was present.
Aware of myself and my existence in a continuous way.
And the weirdest part?
That awareness didn’t take up space in my mind.
It made space.
I realized how much my brain could actually hold—how much input it could take in—when it wasn’t constantly chewing through my entire attention span.
Thoughts still came.
But they couldn’t grip me.
Even if one grabbed me for a few seconds, my awareness noticed.
I saw the thought form arise.
I saw what triggered it.
I saw how long it held me.
And I saw how, for those seconds, I’d forgotten I even existed.
But then I’d smile—and bring my attention back.
And for minutes at a time—sometimes more—I’d be in that zone.
Fully present.
Even when I drifted slightly, I stayed in the flow.
Because the thoughts had no grip.
These breakthrough moments came every few days.
I couldn’t force them. Couldn’t time them.
All I could do was stay present, moment to moment—and I knew they’d come.
Even when they weren’t happening, I was still more present and aware than I’d probably ever been before.
But those moments—those other states—they were something else.
Like tapping into a completely different reality.
Like the shift from dreaming to being awake.


## Restaurant Comes Alive

Another time—I was sitting in a crowded restaurant with friends.
The place was noisy, full of people.
I was trying to stay aware. Catching myself whenever I drifted.
But mostly, I was in my regular daily mode—semi-asleep.
Then suddenly—boom.
It happened.
All those thoughts, identities, stories that usually take up so much of my attention… just disappeared.
My senses sharpened like crazy.
It was like the whole background got upgraded to 3D.
Like a video buffering from low resolution to full HD—pixel by pixel.
I looked around—and it was all there. All of it.
The bar. The whiskey bottles. The shelves. The picture frames on the wall. The people at the next table. The glass I was holding.
Each object sharp and vivid—together and alone.
It wasn’t just clarity—it was volume. Too much to take in. And yet, it all came through.
It felt ecstatic. Trippy.
And I was aware that I was alive..
Like: Here I am. Awake again in the Matrix.
Anyone else awake?
To be honest, these moments are addictive.
They can definitely become another kind of adrenaline rush.
But chasing the rush doesn't really lead you back.


## Intense Moments of Presence
One of the most intense moments of presence I ever had was while cleaning my room.
There’s something I always liked about cleaning.
When your mind gets more organized, you want your space to match.
And vice versa.
So I was just cleaning my room—and with every wipe, I felt more and more present.
Until it was overwhelming.
Tears in my eyes.
This overwhelming feeling of gratitude.
Looking around at the house, the mirror, the light—
I wanted to cry because it was all so incredibly beautiful.
Like just the fact that I exist.
That existence exists.
That was enough to make me want to fall to my knees.
To scream and cry out of pure love, ecstasy, and gratitude.

One time I was washing dishes, just trying to be present.
The repetitive movement helped—it put my mind into a rhythm.

Music was playing.

And then it hit.
I became present.

And suddenly the music felt insanely emotional—beautiful to the point of tears.
I could hear every instrument separately, and together.
The space between them. The movement of the chords.

My relative pitch felt way sharper.

And then I had this realization—what an extreme shift in perception presence can bring.

Because all of it—the harmony, the richness, the structure—was always there.
But with all the mind noise, it usually feels distant. Like something you have to reach for.

But it’s not.

I wasn’t discovering some higher dimension. It was just this world—the real one—finally clear.

And the feeling was so strong, so alive, that I almost paused the music right there—
just to go outside and announce to the world what I’d just seen.


And it didn’t only happen in poetic or peaceful moments.
One time, I was in the middle of a migraine—something that usually knocks me out completely. 
But suddenly, while the pain was still there, something deeper opened up.
There was a part of me that just existed.
Still.
Aware.
Okay.
Another time, I woke up from a nap—and I was there.
Full presence.
No buildup.
Just hello. I’m here again.

And in those moments, the world didn’t just look real—it looked designed.
I’d look at a palm tree and swear it was shaped like a giant upside-down broom, just waiting to be snatched and sweep the sky.
I’d look at a car and it’d be making a face at me—headlights like cartoon eyes, grinning back.
Everywhere I looked, things seemed to resemble each other.
Like the whole world was some kind of visual pun.
A joke only the present moment gets.
And sometimes the space itself felt different—like the sky wasn’t even that far away.
I’d look up and feel like I could just reach out and snatch an airplane from the clouds, like a toy glued to a painting.
Not literal, of course. But there was something about the silence, the clarity, the sharpness of it all—it made everything feel… accessible.
Sometimes I’d laugh because it felt like the universe was playing a joke on us.
Like it had paused itself and said, “Let’s see if anyone notices how weird and wonderful this all is.”


## A Street Walker’s Trip Report

One moment I remember: I was walking for maybe an hour, trying to be present.
Doing the whole shtick.
Eventually, I reached the beach.
I gave up.
Sat down.
Took out my phone.
Started watching NBA highlights.
And then—after a minute—I lifted my head and looked at the horizon.
Boom.
There it goes again.
Full HD.
My awareness snapped back into my senses and body.
I was awake.
I think the walk had already quieted my mind mostly, but there were still a few thoughts holding on.
And letting my mind drift to YouTube—that somehow broke the last grip.
It let my attention go free again.
One time I was walking down Dizengoff Street, trying to get back into that state—trying to become aware.
I was struggling.
Yeah, I had quieted my mind somewhat, but there were still thoughts that had my full attention.
Mostly thoughts about being aware.
Thoughts about thoughts.
They felt obsessive.
It got to a point where I thought—maybe I’ve gone too far with this stuff.
Maybe it’s dangerous.
Maybe I’m gonna go crazy.
But something about that thought felt so extreme.
Like my mind had overplayed its hand.
Like it was the last trick in its book.
And then—boom—I woke up again.
Back to presence.
Clarity.
Space.
Silence.
I felt weightless.
Walking down the street on my tiptoes.
Wanting to savor every moment. Every breath.
I was looking people in the eyes like—yo, is anybody home?
And you look around, and you see it.
You see how asleep everyone is.
Trapped in their own minds.
And yeah, they’re kind of noticing you, and their surroundings, but it barely gets in.
And you feel this weird mix—empathy and awe.
On one hand, you’re like: Damn, they’re sleepwalking.
On the other hand, you’re like: They’re so beautiful.
So cinematic.
It felt like everyone was already enlightened—they just didn’t know it.
Like, people were playing their roles with so much swag, so much beauty.
Maybe they’re not aware of it.
But they are it.

Sometimes it felt like some mysterious alien just came up, tapped a few buttons on the back of my head —

— and boom.

The world cracked open. Everything was beautiful.

I looked around, wondering,
“Wait… were they seeing this all along?”

He was already fading away, smiling.

Maybe he whispered,

“Don’t worry… just be here.”

In those moments, social anxiety doesn’t exist.
Because you see how everyone’s just stuck in their own loop.
And it’s like becoming lucid in a dream—you start to act silly because you realize none of it matters.
People might look at you.
They might judge you.
But you see how shallow that judgment is.
They’re not really paying attention.
99% of their focus is still on themselves.
It’s trippy.
But it doesn’t make you feel disconnected.
It makes you feel love.
You see the inner child in people.
In yourself.
You make eye contact with someone on the street, and you see them notice you for a second.
You can see it generate a thought or two in their mind.
Then they drift away again—off to the next thought, the next trigger.


## The Scientist and the Experiment

I really felt like a scientist on a mission—trying to go deeper and deeper.
Trying not to let my mind trick me.
I learned a lot about how I think.
Some of my defense mechanisms. Patterns.
I was also trying to understand how these moments of awareness actually happened—to catch the mechanics of it, to maybe learn how to control it.
Like, if I could become aware enough in the very moment of becoming aware…
Maybe I could study that moment.
Break it down.
Maybe then I could find a way to access it again on demand.

**I also started noticing that not all fantasies were the same. There were different modes.
Some were negative—driven by rejection, pain, fear. Others were more seductive—visions of success, love, power.
And each mode seemed to come with its own emotional fuel. Different moods triggered different tracks.

At some point, I even started getting mechanical with it—like I could feel my body trying to create the right emotional charge to sustain a positive fantasy… while still trying to stay present.

But it never really worked. It’s a weird trick the mind plays—like trying to eat cake and meditate at the same time.**

I did start noticing patterns.
Social moments, for example, were some of the most difficult.
Even when I was making a real effort to stay aware, it just didn’t happen.
I’d be trying to stay grounded, but the presence wouldn’t come.
It was like the signal couldn’t get through all the noise.
But then, sometimes—later—on the walk home, something would open.
Subtle, but clear.
Like awareness had been waiting in the background, and now it stepped forward.
It was almost like these states were a side effect of my conscious efforts.
And then there were those moments that felt almost poetic.
Like I would suddenly feel the absurdity of it all—
how deep into distraction or unconsciousness I could go before noticing I was gone.
And that very realization would snap me back.
Like: Wait. I exist.
I’m right here.
How did I not notice that before?

But it was an endless chase.
Because even when those moments did come, they were so overwhelming—in a good way—that it became hard to stay present inside them.
You’d get swept away by the beauty. By the ecstasy.
And that very intensity would paradoxically knock you out of the state.
One of the most meaningful insights I had into how my mind works was around ego defense.
I discovered that whenever my ego took a hit—say, I got rejected or embarrassed—my mind would immediately go into fantasy mode.
I’d start imagining how I’d bounce back, succeed massively, prove everyone wrong.
I never noticed it before. But it happened all the time.
Like one time, I was walking down the street, doing one of my regular meditative walks.
And I got a phone call telling me I didn’t get a job I was sure I had in the bag.
My ego took a hit.
And within seconds, I drifted into thoughts like:
How dumb are they? I’ll get back into tech, crush it, and show them all. They’ll regret it. Watch.
But then—after a minute or two—I woke up.
I realized my mind had drifted.
And in that moment of bringing my attention back to presence, I saw the pattern.
I saw why I was having those ambitious thoughts.
It was just a defense mechanism.
And I smiled.
It was a “gotcha” moment.
There was empathy too—for myself.
For how my mind was trying to protect me.
It’s like I caught my mind in the act.
My mind exposed itself—maybe because it didn’t realize I was aware.
Thoughts are just thoughts. They’re not awareness.
So the mind just ran its usual program.
But when I was deeply present, I could see the whole process:
The trigger, the thought chain, the emotional tone.
And once you see that… it loses its grip.
The same thought patterns still came up—but they didn’t have that spell over me anymore.
They didn’t feel true the way they used to.
And I could let go.
That’s one of the wildest things about presence.
It’s like being in a battle against your own mind.
And your mind is insanely clever—because most of the time, you think your thinking mind is you.
But when you’re fully present, the mind still does its thing.
It still thinks. It still gets triggered.
But it doesn’t know that you’re aware.
So it exposes itself.
But it recovers fast.
It immediately tries to merge with your “higher self.”
To stay relevant.
And you start to notice how sneaky the mind is.
How it tries to take credit.
How it tries to hijack even your desire to be present.
Think about it:
The part of you that wants to be present—that’s also just a thought.
You can become enlightened.
But the “you” that wants it…
That part won’t be there when it happens.
That’s why I think this is a lifelong thing.
You never fully “control” the mind.
You just keep remembering.
I started to realize that most of the time, in my normal state, every thought or emotion I focus on grabs all of my attention to the point where I forget I exist—forget I’m right here, right now.
It’s like every thought, in the moment, totally convinces me and pulls me in, as if it’s the most important thing in the world.
And I can’t let it go—because letting go of it feels like letting go of myself.
It doesn’t make sense logically, but that’s how it feels.
My mind just runs from thought to thought, sometimes triggered by something tiny.
Like I’m walking down the street, and I see a guy who kind of looks like someone I know. And suddenly my mind starts spinning—within 10 or 15 seconds, it turns into a whole worry or fantasy that could last for minutes or even hours.
One thought leads to the next, and it all feels so real—so not random.
Like: There’s a reason I’m thinking this. I can’t just let it go. What if I forget something important?
And in my normal state of awareness—what I’d known up until that point in life—I never even noticed what triggered the thought in the first place.
I wouldn’t remember that this entire spiral of worry or planning I’ve been stuck in for the past 10 minutes was randomly kicked off by seeing someone I didn’t even consciously register.
And before that trigger, I had already been in the middle of thinking about something else that felt just as important.
Same feeling.
In those moments, you are the thought.
You don’t really exist—you’re not present—because the thought has you fully hooked.
But in those moments of self-awareness—or presence —you start to see your thoughts for what they are.
You see what triggered them.
How one leads to another.
How each one so easily convinces you and grabs your full attention like, “Yo, we really need to think about this right now.”
And when you’re aware, you can see the whole chain play out.
And you just smile.
You let go of the thought, because you know—it’s just a little trigger.
And you bring your attention back to the here and now.
You remember that you’re alive. That you exist.


## How Far Am I from Enlightenment?

During those few months, to be honest, I really thought I was probably just weeks—or maybe months—away from becoming enlightened.
What I understood that to mean was: being in that state all the time. Or most of the time.
Or at least being able to enter it on demand, after a few minutes of meditation.
I was reading Eckhart Tolle and, later, other teachers like Mooji and Gurdjieff.
And they all made it sound like you could turn this into a permanent state.
And I was like—yeah, I feel pretty close. I might actually be the one…
Now, looking back, my perspective has changed.
These days, I connect more to spiritual content that’s grounded.
More down-to-earth.
Realistic.
My grandma once told me that one of her therapists said:
“If you can be present for ten minutes a day, that’s incredible.”
That stuck with me.
And listening to people like Ram Dass and Alan Watts also helped me realize—this state isn’t something you can expect to control.
Not in the middle of a full, busy life.
Not unless you’re in a monastery, cut off from everything.
There’s also a kind of comfort in that.
I remember having this one insight after the high of presence had faded.
It was something like:
Maybe being enlightened… is not being enlightened after all.
Maybe it just is what it is.
You try to be present.
If you are—great.
If you’re not—then great too.
My grandma also talks a lot about how God is in the darkness, not just the light.
That being present isn’t just about the ecstatic moments.
It’s also about awareness in moments of struggle—confusion, overwhelm.
At first, I didn’t totally connect to that.
For me, the presence always came with some kind of ecstasy.
So I didn’t really get what she meant.
But lately, I think I’ve started to understand it more.
There’ve been moments where I’ve had deeper awareness—where I realized that everything is actually okay.
Not perfect.
Not amazing.
Maybe my body hurts, maybe I feel sad, disgusted, whatever…
But a part of me sees that even though I feel that—it’s not that bad.
I’m still okay.
The ride is still worth it.
I’ve had moments lately where I stopped worrying about worrying.
Where I stopped resisting what I was feeling so much—because it wasn’t even that bad.
I think awareness is probably an infinite space.
And every time a little more space gets cleared up—
It feels amazing.
And spacious.


## Psychedelics and Spiritual Content

In the first few months of this journey, I wasn’t even trying to gain spiritual knowledge or consume spiritual content.
I thought I had it figured out.
Just: try to be present in every moment.
Notice when your mind drifts to the past or future.
Gently bring it back.
That was the whole shtick.
Later on, when the presence started to fade—and I began to feel less connected—that’s when I started getting into spiritual content.
And later, psychedelics too.
But for those first few months, there was no need for any of it.
Interestingly enough, when I did later take psychedelics—like acid, MDMA, Changa—it came from a place of wanting to reconnect.
I wasn’t trying to discover something new.
I was looking for a trailer, a taste, a motivation to get back to a place I already knew.
And yeah, sometimes while on those drugs, I did feel present.
There were powerful moments. No question.
But still—none of those drugs came close to what I experienced in those natural states of presence and awareness.
The drugs felt like energy.
Something strong inside me.
Like they unlocked or amplified something with intensity.
But that energy wasn’t the same thing as presence.
Presence wasn’t part of the package—it was something different.
The trip was real, but it wasn’t the presence I had known.
So for me, it wasn’t about how powerful the experience was.
It was about:
Am I actually present? Am I aware?
And no matter how strong or insightful the trip was, it didn’t necessarily bring me closer to that.


## The Inner Compass
One of the things that developed in me during that time was kind of an inner compass—an awareness tracker.
Think of it as a new manager in charge, not quite the boss but manages the system, whose job was to notice when I was drifting.
His job was basically to wake me up.

But it wasn’t just an alarm clock. It was also like my body was constantly scanning the environment—using my level of sensory awareness and this subtle sense of inner quiet—to measure, at any given moment, how awake I was.
Not just whether I was present or not, but how present. How much space there was in my mind.
It wasn’t something I had to think about—it just happened. Like a system running in the background, checking: Where am I right now? How clear is this moment?


This inner alarm clock could actually be annoying and difficult sometimes, because once you’ve seen something, you can’t unsee it.
You start feeling like you’re asleep whenever you’re not “awake,” and that can become exhausting.
This inner compass, this alarm clock, became a central part of my existence.
Sometimes it felt like I was that guy at a webinar, trying so hard not to fall asleep—but I was just too tired.
Nodding off, waking up again.
And again.
Exhausted.
I say all this because there’s a price to pay.
This thing can even be potentially dangerous.
You’re going deep into your mind.
You’re operating on yourself.
It’s kind of scary.
Because once you start seeing how your mind works, you also see how easily it can trick you.
You can forget.
You can lose your way.
Some people say you should do this kind of work in a group, or with a teacher—because the mind is just too sneaky to handle alone.
Later, I did join some groups.
Spiritual groups. Meditation groups. A Gurdjieff group.
None of them totally worked for me.
I couldn’t fully believe in the systems. The people.
They all felt too structured, too religious, too naive.
But even so, they did help me—at least from the perspective of challenging myself and giving me more chances to practice being present during those meetings.


## Objective Truth

Regarding questions of God or some objective understanding of the universe, afterlife, or whatever—
I cannot say that I saw something objective and definitive in those moments.
But it did shape how I think of God.
It inspired me to connect to different ideas of how I see the universe and myself.
They say everything is one, all that exists is consciousness.
Did I see that in that moment as some kind of objective truth?
No.
But it does kind of make sense, and it definitely inspired me to connect to the idea of life and the universe as God playing hide and seek with itself—
That all that exists is only awareness and God, and we kind of forgot who we are.
We forgot that we were God, and we’re pretending not to be God.
Also, the idea of the afterlife felt interesting from the perspective that it made sense that awareness can potentially survive my body’s death.
But I’m not sure about all this.
It wasn’t a clear aspect of this state.
This state is more what I later saw in Gurdjieff and Ouspensky’s definition of the state of consciousness as the third state.
They say man has four states: dreaming, waking, self-remembering, and objective awareness.
What I experienced is the third state of self-remembering, which also activates a higher emotional state, according to Gurdjieff.
It’s a state where you’re fully present and aware of your existence from moment to moment—
Not as a thought but really aware.
Ouspensky says it’s like that rare moment in life where you suddenly think to yourself: how weird, I exist and I’m right here, right now.
Naturally, this happens to us humans very rarely—maybe in a big trauma or other very meaningful moments in life where our mind suddenly goes quiet and we are fully present in our senses, in our body, in the awareness of being aware and being alive.
It’s those moments where people like to say, “Where were you when you heard about 9/11?”
You remember those moments in life much more clearly.
Most memories are mixed with memories of memories built over the years.
It’s more like we know something happened, but we can’t relive it.
But then there are those rare moments where we remember what it smelled like, where we were, what it felt like, etc.—
Something we never forget.
Those are moments of self-remembering.
Not only are they incredibly sharp in real time, but they also leave a much stronger mark in the memory of not only what happened in that moment, but maybe also what happened in the moments before leading up to it—
Similar to when you wake up, and for the first few minutes or seconds you remember your dreams.
Same goes here.
So these moments didn’t necessarily explain to me how the universe works or reveal some objective truth,
but intuitively, I really connected to the idea that the only thing that exists is awareness—
and we are all God, we just forgot.
Also, when I’m out of the experience—like now, for example—
yes, I’m able to come back with memories and words to describe it, but I’m not in it.
And when you’re not in it, you’re not fully aware, so I don’t fully remember or know what it is now.
But the good thing is that—similar to regular sleep and waking up—
every time you wake up, you remember everything: who you are, where you are, what you dreamt.
So same applies here.
Now I will also say—
it gives you a new perspective on religion.
Because you kind of realize that that’s the purpose of all these religions—
but most people have no idea.
No clue.
Another reason why it made me see it as God—this awareness, this presence—
is because for me, growing up in a religious background,
I was kind of forced from a young age to believe in God and Judaism, the Bible, the whole thing.
And while I didn’t challenge it directly—because they got to my mind from the perspective of “of course God is real and Judaism is true, and whoever thinks differently is silly”…
Do you really think you’re smarter than all these big thinkers before you, and just because you have some so-called hard questions you think you understand something?
Or are you really gonna take the chance of going to hell if you’re wrong?
That worked on me.
But for me, from a young age, I was like:
Screw you, God. I’m not listening to you. Do what you want about it.
And by the way—why are you God and not me?
It’s not fair.
But now, from this perspective, I found a new way to connect to “God” as my inner self.
And there’s no one else to complain to, because we are all that exists.
We kind of put ourselves into this situation.
But I don’t know these things to be some objective fact.
I just connect to it.
The beauty of this is that, from a perspective of seeing our core self as awareness—as the witness, as being aware—
all these questions don’t really matter.
Does God exist?
What happens after we die?
Those are just more thoughts to be aware of.
The only thing that is really real is me—now—aware in this present moment before words and thoughts.
So it kind of settled that question of God in my mind, from that perspective.


## The Need to Share

Back then, the need to share and show other people—like “yo, look what’s going on”—was very strong,
but also frustrating, because my surroundings—friends, family, whatever—
it felt like they were shrugging it off and not interested, or didn’t understand why I’m so excited and hooked.
You do start to realize that most people have no interest in this.
It sounds too hippie, love-dovey, boring.
And most people—me included, probably—reach it from a crisis, from a low point.
You reach a point in life so low that you have nothing to lose, and then you can let go,
because you already gave up—so no pressure.
But for people who struggle less from mental health issues or whatever,
or are less emotional or intuitive—what is their motivation to try to be present?
In general, most of us think we are already present more or less—or at least can be if we want.
So why work hard for something you already have?
Sometimes I feel like I want to shout at people and say:
yo, you have no idea what you’re missing.
This isn’t some moral thing, some hippie peace-and-love thing.
This is our mind.
This is science.
This is the real software behind the story.
This is ecstasy.
This is wild.

Sometimes I literally felt like going up to people—friends, strangers, whatever—and just gently tapping them on the arm,
like: “Hey. Are you hearing this?”
Like I wanted to physically switch them into awareness.
Give their invisible AirPods a long pinch—flip them into transparency mode.
Let the silence in. Let the world in.
Not to teach, not to preach—just to share that shift. That feeling.

it fascinates me—like I’m fascinated by AI or other tech or whatever.
Furthermore, I don’t know what further potential our mind has—probably much more than I experienced.
Especially since Gurdjieff also talks about the fourth state: objective consciousness.


## Medication’s Role

I don’t know how much the Zoloft played a part in this.
I was on and off this drug until I decided to quit.
I was still experiencing some of the breakthroughs after I was off the medication, but I know it played a part.
The way I see it, for the most part, it gave me just enough of the minimum energy needed to get out of the depression paradox—
of if you work out, you’ll feel better, but how do you have the energy to work out if you’re depressed in the first place?
For the most part, I haven’t been using medication anymore.
Maybe I’ll reconsider in the future, maybe not.
One of the reasons I am mentioning this is because I believe you need some kind of energy to be able to be present and do that mind-exercise work.
The way to generate this energy can be by challenging yourself, getting out of your comfort zone, doing brave psychological inner work.
You can never just brute force your mind to enlightenment.
That would be like trying to run a marathon without being in shape and saying,
“Yeah, I have enough willpower, I’ll just keep going regardless.”
But we all know it doesn’t work like that.
It’s impossible.
You’ll quit—or collapse.
Same goes with presence.
It requires inner work.
You need to create—what Gurdjieff calls—some energy you can use to try and be awake.
For me, in the beginning at least, the medication was part of that.
And honestly, it’s kind of annoying.
It’s an ego hit.
Like maybe I didn’t generate this totally by myself.
But regardless—not all of those moments happened while I was on medication.
And looking forward to a potential chapter two, I’m not on anything right now.
But I’m always open-minded to trying new stuff in the future if it feels right.


## The Fade, Back to Normal

Eventually, they started to fade.
But they didn’t disappear without leaving something behind.
They left a radical change in how I saw life—
and how I saw myself.
And they left memories.
Little sparks.
Like, I’ll be out on a walk, and for a second or two, it’ll come back.
Just a flicker.
And I remember more about how it felt—what it was.
I was doing it full time for a very long time,
and even as it was fading, that inner compass and alarm clock were still there.
The memories are still there.
I know how to report what I saw—
I cannot totally explain it or understand it when I’m not there,
but I saw enough to the point where I’m like:
guys, I have to share with you what just happened and what I discovered.
I was there.
I was here.
Over time, these experiences faded to the point that, for the most part, I’m doubting if they’ll ever return.
Even if not—life is still worth it.
Still a wild ride.
And to be honest, it felt like it’s worth a full lifetime—
the good and the bad, the ups and the downs—
just to experience a few moments of this.
It’s all worth it.
The memories it gave me, the insights, the hope, the purpose.
It was life-changing and always will be for me, regardless of what the future holds.
But it did fade—especially after I returned to tech and the routine hustle.
Three and a half years later, here I am again—addicted to weed.
I quit my job again, partly because I felt overwhelmed.
Work was getting super hard for me, and I was taking everything in a very sensitive way.
That, combined with the weed addiction, brought me to a point where I felt I couldn’t handle it anymore—so I quit.
I am, first of all, proud of myself that I lasted for three and a half years
(I challenged myself when coming back to high-tech to last at least two years),
and I made it to three and a half.
And even though I quit again, half in crisis and still not able to quit weed,
this time it’s a huge progress from last time.
I don’t see myself as depressed—just lacking energy.
And I have a plan.
I have a vision.
Because this time I kind of planned it.
It wasn’t just “I quit, I’m done, I can’t take it anymore.”
This time it was:
Let me take a few months to try and hit restart.
See what other options I have.
Maybe I can find a source of income besides being a software engineer.
Maybe I can follow my passion and strengths more.
Because even in tech—which I’m actually pretty good at—
I feel like it’s not me.
And I feel like I’m using the same skills of trying to be aware, to observe, to excel in anything in life.
And if that’s all I know—to observe, to look for patterns, to understand, to contain—
then I wish I did something that fulfilled me and gave me passion, etc.
Ironically, after quitting my job, some presence has started to come back into my life.
No big breakthroughs, but something is shifting.
It’s like I wasn’t hearing the alarms going off all this time because of the routine stress.
But now I’m hearing that inner call again, and I want to do something about it.
I feel like this is my shtick.
And I wish I could just try to be present, be a thinker, a philosopher—and that’s it.
I don’t know how. Or if.
I don’t know if I have the discipline to make a real change in my life.
But what I do know is that that first period—that first wave of my awakening—was real.
And I feel like I might be approaching the second wave.
And given that it will be based on and built on the first wave—
on all my understandings, insights, and experiences in life up until now—
maybe it might even be deeper than the first.


## A Flare In The Sky

Am I crazy if I feel like I can be some kind of consciousness scientist—where I am both the scientist and the experiment?
I don’t want to preach.
I don’t want to change anyone.
I don’t want to heal anyone.
But I want to understand myself and everything.
And I want to leave a mark in the sand—
fire up a flare to say to the world:
This is me.
I was here.
I was present.
I tried.

I was thinking—maybe I’ll try to create some kind of memoir.
Some witness to all my experience.
Maybe a book one day.
Maybe social media.
Maybe a blog.
I have no idea.
But I feel like my experience can have some value to the world—
as a kind of experimental memoir.
A trip report.
A case study.
Something that leaves a mark.
I have no idea what comes next.
But I will say this:
I’ve seen something.
I’ve been there.
And I’m not gonna stay quiet about it—at least not this one time.
I’m here to report on what I saw.
I think I’m going back in.
You Coming!?
